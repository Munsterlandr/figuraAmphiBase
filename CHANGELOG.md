Texture's accessory layers have basically the same UVs as the base layers, but shifted horizontally +64 pixels.

## Changes
* refactored code _again_
* moved transformation handler to the front of the script so it's easier to edit

## Known issues
* animations for using a spyglass and blowing a horn don't look good
* nameplate does not move to a better looking spot (I might fix this later, but it's not easy to test by myself so it could take some time lol)
