pose planning:
The order registered does matter, as it determines the order of execution of animators.
suffixes: none means it's got no code directly messing with it, !<animator> means it has an animator, # means comment. If the ! is not followed by anything, the animator is unique.

Animator rework planning:
instead of the old system where they're distinct from poses, this will have them be a component of poses.

Ears system rework:
Move a lot of the specific pose stuff to their respective poses, and instead only have the ears pose add some physics to them.

The new physics system should work by calculating the angle towards the tip of the ear during the last tick, and readjust based on how big that angle is.
