pose planning:
suffixes: none means it's got no code directly messing with it, !<animSystem> means it has an animator, # means comment. multiple animators can affect the same pose, and commas separate these.

animator order:
note: animators only run if at least one of the poses they effect has a strength above zero, when checked at root. Ones where the order could be whatever are grouped with commas.
