pose planning:
The order registered does matter, as it determines the order of execution of animators.
suffixes: none means it's got no code directly messing with it, !<animator> means it has an animator, # means comment. If the ! is not followed by anything, the animator is unique.

Animator rework planning:
instead of the old system where they're distinct from poses, this will have them be a component of poses.
